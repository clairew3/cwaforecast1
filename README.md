# Intro

This is a simple frontend web app that shows weather information from CWA, including observation of 10~20 mins ago, and forecast for 36 hours and 7 days. 

We developed it using Vue 3, Vitest and CWA API. 


## Screenshots

## Setup

As a pure frontend web app, it requires a CWA authorization to run. Checkout `/doc/Setup.md` for more details.
